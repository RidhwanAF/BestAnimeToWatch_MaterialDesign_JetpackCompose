# BestAnimeToWatch_MaterialDesign_JetpackCompose
This is my first Android app developed using Jetpack Compose. It showcases a curated list of some of the best anime series that I've watched.

App Purpose:
The primary objective of this app is to demonstrate the power of Jetpack Compose in creating dynamic user interfaces. Please note that the app uses static data and is primarily intended for practice purposes. It focuses on presenting the anime list with visually appealing animations.

Video Demo:
For a detailed demonstration of the app's features and user interface, please watch the video demo linked below:
